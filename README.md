This project focuses on analyzing hardware sales data to extract significant insights regarding suppliers, inventory, sales trends, pricing strategies, and product demand. Utilizing the hardwaredata.csv dataset from Kaggle, the analysis involved preprocessing steps such as removing missing values and converting categorical data into binary formats. Various visualization techniques were applied, including pie charts, bar charts, and scatter plots, to illustrate relationships within the data. Key findings revealed that Supplier A dominates in market share and inventory size, while Supplier B excels in sales volume despite a smaller market share. The project highlights critical correlations between pricing and sales, with screws identified as the top-selling product. Overall, this analysis provides valuable information for optimizing inventory management and pricing strategies within the hardware market.
